The similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items.\nThere are two types of Collaborative Filtering:\n1.User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users. \n2.Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.\n\nin this notebook we will work with the user based recommendation technique as following:\n1.import the data and split it into training and testing data.\n2.find 20 nearest neighbors using cosine metric.\n3.collect the movies watched by the neighbors and not watched yet from the target user.\n4.calculate user predicted ratings.\n5.create recommedations withthe top 20 predicted movies."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we will start by importing and splitting the data into training and testing data. we will use the testing data to evaluate the recommendation later on."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel, cosine_similarity\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movies=pd.read_csv('../input/movies-dataset/movies.csv')\nratings=pd.read_csv('../input/movies-dataset/ratings.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#check if there is any none values \nratings.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we will round the rating to be integer values."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings['rating']=round(ratings['rating'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ntraining ,testing =train_test_split(ratings,\n                                   stratify=ratings['userId'], \n                                   test_size=0.20,\n                                   random_state=42)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we fill null value ratings with zeros so we can apply nearest neighbors. but we should replace it with NaN when we calculate the means."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df= training.pivot(index='userId',columns='movieId',values='rating')\ndf.fillna(0,inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we will use cosine as a metric so nearest neighbors will be calculated based on cosine similarity between users."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nmodel_knn = NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine', algorithm='brute', n_neighbors=20, n_jobs=-1)\nmodel_knn.fit(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we will use this formula to calculate the predicted mean:\n![Predicted rating formella](https://i.ibb.co/hf2wDdf/Screen-Shot-2021-03-04-at-11-35-24-AM.png)\n    \n    "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def getRecommendations(userId):\n    user_movies=df.columns[df.loc[userId].to_numpy().nonzero()[0]]\n    user_mean=df.loc[userId].replace(0, np.NaN).mean()\n    distances, indices = model_knn.kneighbors([df.iloc[0]], n_neighbors=20)\n    neighbors=indices[0][1:]\n    #find the similarity between user and neighbors\n    sim=1-distances[0][1:]\n    \n    # find movies rated by neighbors\n    neighbors_movies=df.iloc[neighbors,:].sum()\n    neighbors_movies=neighbors_movies.loc[neighbors_movies>0].index\n    neighbors_movies= set(neighbors_movies)-set(user_movies)\n    \n    neighbors_ratings=df.iloc[neighbors]\n    neighbors_ratings = neighbors_ratings.replace(0, np.NaN)\n    neighbors_mean= neighbors_ratings.mean(axis=1)\n    \n    reco_list=[]\n    for movie in neighbors_movies:\n        neighbors_rating=neighbors_ratings.loc[:,movie]\n        sum=((neighbors_rating-neighbors_mean)*sim).sum()\n        prediction=user_mean+(sum/sim.sum())\n        reco_list.append([movie,round(prediction)])\n        \n    # sort movies by ratings    \n    reco_df = pd.DataFrame(reco_list, columns=['movieId','est_rating']).sort_values(by='est_rating',ascending=False)\n    return reco_df    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Surprise KNNWithMean Model\n\nThere is a famous library for recommendations called  Surprise. if we used the KNNWithMeans model from the library, it will do almost what we did  in our model.
